# Overview

[Current Features](./Features.md) 

The Tile Manager handles all of the tile loading and placing.

### Tile Placing

There are two separate tile maps one of the walls and the other for the floor.
The walls tilemap has collision this helps with player interaction.

### Tile Dictionaries

There are two dictionaries that store a tiles position within the tilemap
and it's custom tile.



### Tile Loading

By using the resources folder I load in all of the tiles that I have created.
These then get organised into lists based on their type.
