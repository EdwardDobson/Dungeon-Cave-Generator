# Overview

[Current Features](./Features.md) 

The Tile Manager handles all of the tile loading and placing.

### Tile Placing

There are two separate tile maps one of the walls and the other for the floor.
This helps lower the search times, improving performance.

### Tile Loading

By using the resources folder I load in all of the tiles that I have created.
These then get organised into lists based on their type.
