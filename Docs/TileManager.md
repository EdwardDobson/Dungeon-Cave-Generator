# Overview

[Current Features](./Features.md) 

The Tile Manager handles all of the tile loading and placing.

### Tile Placing

There are two separate tile maps one of the walls and the other for the floor.
This helps lower the search times, improving performance.
To help organise all of the tiles from both these tile maps and to allow my custom tiles to be used I use two dictionaries.

### Tile Loading

By using the resources folder I load in all of the tiles that I have created.
These then get organised into lists based on their type.
